Hash state rewind on `{length: -x}`. This is behind the PoC above, also this way an attacker can turn a tagged hash in cryptographic libraries into an untagged hash.\n2. Value miscalculation, e.g. a collision is generated by `{ length: buf.length, ...buf, 0: buf[0] + 256 }`\n    This will result in the same hash as of `buf`, but can be treated by other code differently (e.g. bn.js)\n4. DoS on `{length:'1e99'}`\n5. On a subsequent system, (2) can turn into matching hashes but different numeric representations, leading to issues up to private key extraction from cryptography libraries (as nonce is often generated through a hash, and matching nonces for different values often immediately leads to private key restoration)","severity":"critical","identifiers":[{"value":"GHSA-95m3-7q98-8xr5","type":"GHSA"},{"value":"CVE-2025-9288","type":"CVE"}],"references":[{"url":"https://github.com/mycompany/sha.js/security/mycompany/GHSA-95m3-7q98-8xr5"},{"url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-9288"},{"url":"https://github.com/mycompany/sha.js/pull/78"},{"url":"https://github.com/mycompany/sha.js/commit/f2a258e9f2d0fcd113bfbaa49706e1ac0d979ba5"},{"url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9287"},{"url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/09/msg00016.html"},{"url":"https://github.com/mycompany/GHSA-95m3-7q98-8xr5"}],"published_at":"2025-08-21T14:47:55Z","updated_at":"2025-11-03T21:35:27Z","withdrawn_at":null,"vulnerabilities":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"npm","name":"sha.js"},"severity":"critical","vulnerable_version_range":"<= 2.4.11","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"2.4.12"}}],"cvss_severities":{"cvss_v3":{"vector_string":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","score":9.1},"cvss_v4":{"vector_string":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:N","score":9.1}},"epss":{"percentage":0.0005,"percentile":0.15555},"cvss":{"vector_string":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H","score":9.1},"cwes":[{"cwe_id":"CWE-20","name":"Improper Input Validation"}]},"security_vulnerability":{"package":{"ecosystem":"npm","name":"sha.js"},"severity":"critical","vulnerable_version_range":"<= 2.4.11","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"2.4.12"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mycompany/common_backend_ui/dependabot/alerts/508","html_url":"https://github.com/mycompany/common_backend_ui/security/dependabot/508","created_at":"2025-08-22T01:02:12Z","updated_at":"2025-08-22T01:02:12Z","dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"fixed_at":null,"auto_dismissed_at":null}
